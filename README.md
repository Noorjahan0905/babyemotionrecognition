The bar graph shows the count of emotions used in a baby emotion recognition project: "happy" (160) is the most frequent, followed by "sad" (130), "angry" (120), "disgust" (70), and "calm" (30), indicating varied representation across emotions.

The left graph shows the training loss decreasing steadily while the testing loss fluctuates before decreasing, indicating overfitting initially but improvement later. The right graph shows training accuracy reaching near 100% quickly, while testing accuracy improves gradually, stabilizing around 90% by 50 epochs.
